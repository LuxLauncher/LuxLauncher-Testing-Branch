# LuxLauncher-Testing-Branch
LuxLauncher is a simple and smooth launcher created by ReluxStudios to load only my games directly from GitHub. The idea behind it is to give players an easy, hassle free way to access and play all my games without needing to download anything. Whether you want to jump right into a new game or revisit an old favorite, LuxLauncher makes it quick and convenient by keeping everything in one place.

Because LuxLauncher streams the games directly from GitHub, you’ll need to be connected to the internet to play. If you prefer, you can also download the games from my Game Jolt page to play offline

I built LuxLauncher to remove the barriers between players and my games no complicated installs, no waiting for downloads, just instant access anytime. It’s designed to be straightforward, reliable, and focused solely on delivering my games as smoothly as possible.
